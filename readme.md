# Computer Systems Security Project
Work done for a Systems Security and Audit class, developed in CSharp, with a library of automated tests, using a WebDriver API that allows to perform the tests in the web page, made by: [Amauri Martins Júnior](https://github.com/maumauagain), [Loren Garcia](https://github.com/loren-garcia), [Júlia Nicola Gualeve](https://github.com/junicola) and Igor Gabrig.

## Development
The initial idea is to make the program work with strings already parameterized, which will be read from a .txt file and will be used to take the login test. There will be a function to test if it's possible to make a login with those strings and there will be another function to test how many chances we will have to try to login.

## Goal
With this, we will be able to cover great possibilities of sql injection attacks increasing the safety of the website.
